    One-on-one chat: Enjoy private conversations with your friends.
    Real-time updates: Messages appear instantly, keeping the flow of conversation smooth.
    Responsive design: Works flawlessly on various devices, including desktops, laptops, and tablets.
    Temporary nicknames: Choose a temporary nickname for each session, adding a touch of anonymity.
